# Ensemble-Deep-Learning-for-Seismic-Data-Reconstruction
This repository implements ensemble deep learning with TensorFlow. It applies seismic data reconstruction using two branches of U-Net with data transformation modules. We developed a novel deep-learning model that improves the accuracy of reconstructing missing data, specifically weak events, crossing dips, and higher frequencies often missed by traditional methods.
